# Software Development Plan (Waterfall)

### Project Title
Library Management System

### Project Synopsis
The library management system will track the status of all of the books and customers.

### Concept of Operation (CONOPS)
The system is designed to be used by a working librarian. The system will have information such as which books individuals are renting, whether individuals have late fees, whether a book is available for rent or not, etc.


-	The system shall have a log of all users.
-	The system shall have a log of all books.
-	The system shall track date and time.
-	The status of all books shall be accessible (via title, author, or ID number) and updateable, such as:
    -	Whether the book is currently being borrowed
    -	Whether the book is damaged
-	The system shall have the ability to add/remove books from the library’s system.
-	The status of users shall be accessible (via either last name or ID number) and updateable, such as:
    -	The number of books a user is borrowing
    -	The amount of late fees a user has (if the user has late fees)
    -	Whether the user is allowed to borrow a certain book.
        -	A user can not borrow a book either if that book is unavailable, if the user has too many books borrowed, or if the user has too many late fees.
-	The system shall have the ability to add/remove users and books from the library’s system.

The system will accept user inputs from the terminal and update its records based on those inputs.
